# Task

A renovation company needs to hang new wallpaper in a bunch of rooms. They need to cover even the floors and ceilings with it.

They run out of wallpaper so they need to submit an order for more. Knowing the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each room, they want to order only as much as they need.

Every room is a rectangular prism, which makes calculations easier: the surface area of room is 2\*l\*w + 2\*w\*h + 2\*h\*l.

The company also need a little extra wallpaper for each room: the area of the smallest side.

**For example:**
- A room with dimensions 1x2x3 requires 2\*2 + 2\*6 + 2\*3 = 22 square feet of wallpaper plus additional 2 square feet, for a total of 24 square feet.
- A room with dimensions 1x1x5 requires 2\*1 + 2\*5 + 2\*5 = 22 square feet of wallpaper paper plus 1 additional square foot, for a total of 23 square feet.

**All numbers in the rooms list are in feet. Write functionalities taking into account our expectations that will:**
- calculate number of total square feet of wallpaper the company should order for all rooms from input (use provided input file)
- list all rooms from input that have a cubic shape (order by total needed wallpaper descending)
- list all rooms from input that are appearing more than once (order is irrelevant)
